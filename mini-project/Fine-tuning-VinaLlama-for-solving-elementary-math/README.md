# Fine-tuning VinaLlama for Solving Elementary Math

## Overview
In this repository, I fine-tuned the state-of-the-art (SOTA) model vilm/vinallama-7b-chat with the dataset hllj/vi_grade_school_math_mcq to tackle elementary math problems.

This repository documents the fine-tuning process of a model with a specific dataset, serving as a reference for future use. Despite training only one-fifth of the dataset, the results after fine-tuning remain subpar. Nonetheless, the experience of fine-tuning proves insightful and enjoyable.

Additionally, this repository includes a function for creating prompts to aid in model training and testing.

## Outline
1. Install libraries
2. Import necessary libraries.
3. Load pre-trained VinaLlama
4. Test pre-trained model
5. Fine-tune model (prepare dataset + training)
6. Inference

Feel free to explore the repository to understand the process of fine-tuning a model for solving elementary math problems.
