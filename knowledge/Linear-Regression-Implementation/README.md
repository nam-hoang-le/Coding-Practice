# Linear-Regression-Implementation

## Overview 

In this repository, I used two dataset, one for predicting sales and one for predicting house's prices. You can see the dataset together with my code.

Two dataset also equals to two types of linear regression problems, one value and multiple values. 

This repository is basically some easy functions with linear regression: predict, gradient, compute loss, update weights and apply them with two problems 

I also plot the loss values after training through two problems.

## About Linear Regression

Linear Regression is a technique using linear line to solve regression problem (problems with continuous values).

The core is to predict the new value, then calculate the gradient values, then update the weights until the problem was solved.

## Outline
1. Load dataset 
2. Initialize parameters
3. Training 
4. Predicting
